In this organization the basic rules are mutual respect, courtesy and good mood.
The team consists of 6 members, 4 of which are members and 2 owners.
The owners are elected every Thursday and assume their duties from Friday until the next election.
All members have the right to vote. We vote on which combination of members we wish to be owners.
